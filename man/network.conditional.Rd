\title{Produce conditional probabilities of dyads of elements, and graph object based on conditional probabilities}
\usage{
network.conditional(netfacs.data, package = "igraph", min.prob = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{netfacs.data}{object resulting from netfacs() function}

\item{package}{should the graph object be created in sna or igraph?}
}
\value{
Function returns a dataframe that includes all dyadic combinations and their observed and conditional probabilities
}
\description{
For all dyadic combinations that ever appear, this function returns the probability of A occurring (P(A)), the probability of B occurring (P(B)), the probability of A and B occurring simultaneously (P(A+B)), and the probability of A occurring if B is given (P(A|B)). It also creates a graph object that can be plotted
}
\examples{
### how do angry facial expressions differ from non-angry ones?
data(emotions_set)
angry.face = netfacs(data = emotions_set[[1]],
 condition = emotions_set[[2]]$emotion,
 test.condition = 'anger',
 null.condition = NULL,
 duration = NULL, 
 ran.trials = 100,
 control = NULL,
 random.level = NULL,
 combination.size = 5)
 
 conditional.net = network.conditional(angry.face, package = 'igraph')
}
